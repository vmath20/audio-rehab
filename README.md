# Hand Gesture Detection Simulator for Stroke Rehabilitation Therapy

This project is a hand gesture detection simulator designed for stroke rehabilitation therapy. It provides real-time audio feedback to assist individuals in rehabilitating hand movements. By generating sonification based on hand gestures, the simulator helps users engage in exercises that aid recovery. The project includes several `.pde` files for handling notifications, events, text-to-speech, gesture classification, and more.

## Features

- **Real-Time Gesture Detection**: Recognizes nine distinct hand gestures aligned with stroke rehabilitation exercises.
- **Sonification Feedback**: Uses audio synthesis (sine and square waves) to provide real-time audio cues based on hand movements.
- **Visual and Audio Cues**: Simulates exercises with visual sliders and audio cues to assist with movements.
- **Interactive Audio Options**:
  - **Band Music**: Background music that users can adjust in volume.
  - **Saxophone Loop**: A reverb-filtered saxophone loop for practice exercises.
- **2D Hand Positioning**: Tracks the right handâ€™s position on an xy grid for spatial control.
- **Text-to-Speech Warnings**: Alerts users if their body angle is incorrect during exercises.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Processing IDE**: Required for running `.pde` files.
- **Text-to-Speech and Sound Libraries**: Ensure Processing has the necessary libraries for audio and text-to-speech functionality.

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stroke-rehabilitation-simulator.git
   ```
2. Open the main `.pde` file in the Processing IDE.
3. Follow the instructions in the User Manual for guidance on using the simulator.

### Usage
1. **Exercise Test 1**: Click to start a sample video that will trigger gesture recognition.
2. **Adjust Sliders**: Automatic changes can be observed as gestures are detected, or you can manually adjust the sliders.
3. **Sound Options**:
   - **Band Music**: Click to play band music and adjust the volume.
   - **Saxophone**: Click to play a saxophone tune in a reverb loop.
4. **Body Position Monitoring**: Click the body position button to receive a text-to-speech warning if your body angle needs correction.

## File Structure
- **notification.pde**: Handles notifications within the simulator.
- **text_to_speech.pde**: Integrates text-to-speech functionality for audio cues.
- **notification_server.pde**: Manages notification server functionalities.
- **notification_listener.pde**: Listens for specific notifications.
- **notification_comparator.pde**: Compares notifications to trigger responses.
- **helper_functions.pde**: Contains helper functions used across the project.
- **eventHandling.pde**: Manages user interaction events.
- **vaibhavmishra.pde**: Core file with primary simulator logic.
